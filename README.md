Welcome to OpenWalls, where we're putting meshes on walls!

OpenWalls is an open-source Roblox plugin that helps place meshes on blocks in a Roblox
game-building environment. This makes games run more efficiently while also saving
developers time and energy. It is a Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) project
written in Lua and targeted at game developers and script developers alike.

This repository contains the code for the OpenWalls project. Documentation for this
project, including a startup guide, a usage guide, and a technology journal, is
available in the wiki.
